#.   -> not useful, they don't give away the shapefiles;  plus i'm looking for something programmatic 
#

#.  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5126745/gadm-maps-cross-country-comparison-graphics 
#.    -> trying to adapt this code: 
#.       success!  looks like I've downloaded some shapefiles 

india <- getData("GADM", country = 'IND', level = 1)

# let's look at the data
head(india) # okay, it looks like NAME_1 will probably be the state names I'm looking for

str(india, max.level=1) # good, it's spatial data, though we probably want to work with it in sf

# at this point I made the mistake of trying to plot it
# plot(india) 
# this kept hanging -- not sure if the data is too big to plot or if there's some bug

# converting to sf format since those are generally easier to work with
india_sf <- india |> sf::st_as_sf()

# let's try using mapview since i think the html & javascript based approach
# might be less likely to hang 
mapview(india_sf)

# google: why is geom_sf taking so long 
#    results: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rlanguage/comments/vxyou8/plotting_geospatial_data_is_so_slow_how_to_speed/ 
#     skimming answers: 
#     Try using st_simplify to remove some detail and plot again
#     That made a huge difference! It now plots almost instantly.
#      I added this line:
#        sg_hb <- st_simplify(sg_hb, dTolerance = 75)
#    
# i think the data was too big because using st_simplify on it made it
# significantly faster to run
# 
# checking ?st_simplify, the dTolerance argument is specified in meters when
# using the st_simplify function;  st_simplify simplifies geometries by removing
# verticies, so I am totally fine with removing vertices at the 75m resolution
# level when we're only interested in making maps of the entire country
india_sf <- india_sf |> sf::st_simplify(dTolerance=75)

# now this runs: 
ggplot(india_sf) + 
  geom_sf()
